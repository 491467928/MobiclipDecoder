### Supported formats
- 3DS Moflex
- DS Mods
- Wii MOC5 files (no audio and not full speed)

### What is yet to be done
- Support for .vx files and their old (and much different) version of the mobiclip codec
- Find out how to correctly read the audio from MOC5 files
- More refactoring of the code (aka understand it better)
- Implement encoding in mobiconverter
